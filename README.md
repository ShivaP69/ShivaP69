# 👋 Hi, I'm Shiva

🎓 I'm currently a **PhD candidate** at the **University of Basel, Switzerland**, working in the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Security/Privacy**.

## 🔬 Research Focus

My current research primarily focuses on:

- 🧠 **Privacy-preserving Machine Learning**, especially:
  - Attacks and privacy concerns in **recommender systems**
  - Membership inference attacks in **medical imaging**
  - Attacks and privacy concerns in **recommender systems**
-  Evaluating computational trade-offs in **Differential Privacy** (e.g., DPSGD variants)

## 👩‍🏫 Supervision

I supervise Master's and Bachelor's students on topics related to ML, security, and privacy. Some of the recent projects I’ve supervised include:

- 🔍 *Are Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images unique biometric identifiers?*
- 🤖 *Automated Analysis of Smart Toy Privacy Policies using LLMs*
- 🧾 *Privacy Policy Analysis with Large Language Models*
- 💻 *Evaluating new DPSGD variants for computational efficiency*

## 🧠 Skills & Tools

- **Languages**: Python
- **ML/AI**: PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Security/Privacy**: Differential Privacy, Adversarial ML, Inference Attacks
- **Domains**: Medical Imaging, Recommender Systems, Privacy Policy Analysis, LLMs
